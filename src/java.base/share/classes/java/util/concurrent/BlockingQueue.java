 * and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving

 * <p>
 * 接口定义规范 Blocking 中不允许存入 null 值
 * null 的返回值一般用作于 poll 操作为空的返回值
 *
 * <p>A {@code BlockingQueue} does not accept {@code null} elements.
 * Implementations throw {@code NullPointerException} on attempts
 * to {@code add}, {@code put} or {@code offer} a {@code null}.  A
 * {@code null} is used as a sentinel value to indicate failure of
 * {@code poll} operations.
 * <p>
 * BlockingQueue 可能是有界的。
 *
 * <p>A {@code BlockingQueue} may be capacity bounded. At any given
 * time it may have a {@code remainingCapacity} beyond which no
 * additional elements can be {@code put} without blocking.
 * A {@code BlockingQueue} without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
 * reports a remaining capacity of {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
 * <p>
 * BlockingQueue 的实现主要是用于生产消费队列，且支持 Collection 接口。
 * 因为支持 Collection 接口，所以支持移除指定的元素。不像传统的队列只能在队头或者
 * 队尾操作。但是效率很低。
 *
 * <p>{@code BlockingQueue} implementations are designed to be used
 * primarily for producer-consumer queues, but additionally support
 * the {@link Collection} interface.  So, for example, it is
 * possible to remove an arbitrary element from a queue using
 * {@code remove(x)}. However, such operations are in general
 * <em>not</em> performed very efficiently, and are intended for only
 * occasional use, such as when a queued message is cancelled.
 * <p>
 * BlockingQueue 是线程安全的，内部实现使用了锁或者其他的并发控制方法。
 * 打的集合相关的操作没有使用锁，所以在操作失败的时候建议抛出异常。
 *
 * <p>{@code BlockingQueue} implementations are thread-safe.  All
 * queuing methods achieve their effects atomically using internal
 * locks or other forms of concurrency control. However, the
 * <em>bulk</em> Collection operations {@code addAll},
 * {@code containsAll}, {@code retainAll} and {@code removeAll} are
 * <em>not</em> necessarily performed atomically unless specified
 * otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for
 * {@code addAll(c)} to fail (throwing an exception) after adding
 * only some of the elements in {@code c}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code BlockingQueue} does <em>not</em> intrinsically support
 * any kind of &quot;close&quot; or &quot;shutdown&quot; operation to
 * indicate that no more items will be added.  The needs and usage of
 * such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example, a
 * common tactic is for producers to insert special
 * <em>end-of-stream</em> or <em>poison</em> objects, that are
 * interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario.
 * Note that a {@code BlockingQueue} can safely be used with multiple
 * producers and multiple consumers.
 * <pre> {@code
 * class Producer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Producer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while (true) { queue.put(produce()); }
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   Object produce() { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class Consumer implements Runnable {
 *   private final BlockingQueue queue;
 *   Consumer(BlockingQueue q) { queue = q; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     try {
 *       while (true) { consume(queue.take()); }
 *     } catch (InterruptedException ex) { ... handle ...}
 *   }
 *   void consume(Object x) { ... }
 * }
 *
 * class Setup {
 *   void main() {
 *     BlockingQueue q = new SomeQueueImplementation();
 *     Producer p = new Producer(q);
 *     Consumer c1 = new Consumer(q);
 *     Consumer c2 = new Consumer(q);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 *     new Thread(c1).start();
 *     new Thread(c2).start();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
 * collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
 * {@code BlockingQueue}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
 * the {@code BlockingQueue} in another thread.
